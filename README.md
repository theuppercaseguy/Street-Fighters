# MERCY: Protect Thy Honour

A 2d Street Fighter Type  game that I created as my second-semester project.

This program is written in only C++. By using the concepts of OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMING(OOP).

This is an open source project so feel free to use it.

The project was created in Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (Comunity Edition)

Using libraries such as:

- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)

- [SDL_MIXER](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/mixer/)

- [SDL_TTF](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/mixer/)

- [SDL_IMAGE](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/release/)

All the aforementioned libraries are already included in the Project.

so you don't need to download any of them.
